     - Persona research → suggest personas

3. **Storage**:
   - Store file metadata in `uploaded_files` field

   - Extract text and save separately

### Additional Enhancements

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** in development
2. **Add file upload functionality** (see "What's Still Needed")
3. **Integrate with campaign generator** to use persona data
